# Text--NLP---Probability---Python

# Instructions:

The input is a text file containing newline separated strings.

Each string is a word, followed by a tab, followed by a topic.



#1. print the total number of lines.

#2. Print the 10 most common lines.

#3. Print the 10 most common topics, sorted by commonness.  A topic consists of the second part of each line, where each line is independent.

#4. Print the 10 most common words, sorted alphabetically.  A word consists of the first part of each line, where each line is independent.

#5. Print the 10 most common words for each of the top 10 most common topics.

#6. Write a function to compute the probability of a topic, given a word.  In your program, print this value for the 100 pairs of words and topics from #5.

#7. Write a function to compute the probability of a word, given a topic.  In your program, print this value for the 100 pairs of words and topics from #5.

#8. Write into your program a parameter that specifies whether the data should be treated case insensitively (treat "Apple" and "appLE" as the same), or case sensitively.

#9. Write into your program a parameter which specifies the minimum number of times a line must be seen to be considered.

#10. Print the frequency of each word count.  For example, there might be 68 words than occur 4 times, and 9 words that occur 8 times, and so on.
